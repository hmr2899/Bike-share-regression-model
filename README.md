# Bike-share-regression-model

## Background

Bike sharing systems are new generation of traditional bike rentals where whole pro cess from memb ership,
rental and return back has b ecome automatic. Through these systems, user is able to easily rent a bike from
a particular p osition and return back at another p osition. Currently, there are ab out over 500 bike-sharing
programs around the world which is comp osed of over 500 thousands bicycles. To day, there exists great
interest in these systems due to their imp ortant role in trac, environmental and health issues.
Apart from interesting real world applications of bike sharing systems, the characteristics of data b eing
generated by these systems make them attractive for the research. Opp osed to other transp ort services
such as bus or subway, the duration of travel, departure and arrival p osition is explicitly recorded in these
systems. This feature turns bike sharing system into a virtual sensor network that can b e used for sensing
mobility in the city. Hence, it is exp ected that most of imp ortant events in the city could b e detected via
monitoring these data.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to build a regression model that predicts the number of daily bike users and also provide reccomendations from the model results.
